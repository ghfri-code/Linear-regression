**Linear regression** tries to model the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to a series of data.
Implement linear regression using closed form solution and the Gradient Descent algorithm.
Report the learned parameters (θ0 , θ1 , ..., θn ), and also the value of MSE error on the train and test data.
